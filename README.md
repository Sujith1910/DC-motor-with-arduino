# DC-motor-with-arduino
Arduino code for DC motor
* This is a basic arduino code for connecting two DC motors using the L298N motor driver. 
* The motor driver is used to reverse the polarity of the motors and hence reverse the direction of their spinning.
* Connect the enA on L298N to digital pin 3 of Arduino and enB on L298N to digital pin 5 of Arduino.
* Connect in1,in2,in3,in4 to digital pins 8,9,6,7 on the Arduino respectively.
* The code spins the motors in one direction for 3seconds and then stops them for 1second and then spins them in the opposite direction for 3seconds.
